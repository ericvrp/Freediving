This sub-project with codename BlueTick is for experimenting with freediving related code using https://www.meteor.com

To play with this install Meteor followed by:

> meteor update
> meteor

point your browser to the shown url which is usually http://localhost:3000/
note: on this local version you can press ctrl+M in the browser to enable some debugging tool. Meteor collections can also be edited from the browser developer console.

note: occasionally I deploy this app to http://bluetick.meteor.com
